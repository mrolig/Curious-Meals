		<h3><a name="tutorialParts"></a>Five Basic Parts</h3>
		<p><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-ingredient inline'></span> <b>Ingredients</b> are the building blocks for dishes.  Ingredients track the souce (vegan, vegetarian or animal) and the kind of food (Fruit, Vegetable, Protein, etc).</p>
		<p><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-dish inline'></span> <b>Dishes</b> are the bulding blocks for a menu.  Dishes gather all the information of a recipe including a list of ingredients.  You also record the balance of nutrients (Veggetables, Protein, Carbohydrate) to enable you to see how balanced your meal will be.</p>
		<p><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-menu inline'></span> <b>Menus</b> are a collection of dishes, you can see a menu at a glance on the right, or dig deeper to see a list of ingredients needed for all of the dishes.  Menus allow you to see the overall nutritional balance of the meal you're preparing.</p>
		<p><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-tag inline'></span> <b>Tags</b> are words or phrases you can attach to ingredients and dishes.  These enable you to search and organize your library to make it easy to find everything.</p>
		<p><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-folder-collapsed inline'></span> <b>Libraries</b> are a collection of ingredients, dishes, menus and tags.  You can share your library with other users.  If you have access to other libraries, you can only look at them one at a time.  Use the menu in the upper left to switch libraries.</p>
		<h3><a name="tutorialGettingAround"></a>Getting Around</h3>	
		<p>The meal planner displays itself in three main areas that you can se right now; on the left are tabs to search or browse dishes and ingredients; on the right you can see the menu you're currently working with; in the center, where you are reading now, you can see detailed information about each item.</p>
		<h4><a name="tutorialBrowsing"></a>Searching and Browsing</h4>
		<p>On the left are a series of tab with icons for Search, Dishes, Ingredients and Tags.</p>
		<h4>Search</h4>
		<p>You can search by typing keywords into the search box and pressing the search button to its right.  All items that match any word entered will appear below.</p>
		<p>You can filter your search by rating; only dishes with at least as many stars as you select will be displayed. Click on the star to set or clear a rating filter.</p>
		<p>You can also filter you search by tags; only items will appear that contain <i>all</i> of the tags that you enter. Type tags into the edit box below the Tags list and press enter.  Hover the mouse over the tag and click the<span class='remove ui-icon ui-icon-close'></span>to remove it from the search.</p>
		<h4><a name="tutorialDishes"></a>Dishes and Ingredients</h4>
		<p>The two middle tabs list dishes and ingredients in alphabetical order.  Click on the item to read it in more detail.  Hover the mouse over the item to get a quick preview.</p>
		<h4><a name="tutorialTags"></a>Tags</h4>
		<p>The tags tab shows a list of tags from your items.  Clicking on the tag link will search for items with that tag.</p>
		<h4><a name="tutorialMenus"></a>Menus</h4>
		<p>On the right side you can select from your menus and see the content of the currently select menu.  The menu "&lt;New Menu&gt;" is a special menu for you to use while you're constructing a menu.  You can add and remove items from the menu and then use the Save button to save it with a new name. Named menus can be deleted and cloned.</p>
		<p>If you have a dish in the center pane of the meal planner, you can click the Add button to add the dish to the menu.  You can also click and drag a link for any dish to the menu display to add it.</p>
		<p>The menu overview also includes a link "Ingredients, etc. Â»" that will show the details of the menu in the center pane</p>
		<h3><a name="tutorialNutrition"></a>Nutritional Balance</h3>
		<p>The tools for nutritonal balance are roughly based on the <a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/foodgroups/index.html">FDA's guidelines</a> that a balanced meal be close to half a plate of Fruits and Vegetables, a quarter Protein and a quarter Carbohydrates/grains.</p>
		<p>To help show this balance, you should enter information for each dish estimating that balance -- if a dish would satisfy the full serving (quarter plate) of protein, increase the Protein count to 1, if it would satisfy the full serving (half a plate) of Fruits and Vegetables, increase the Fuits a Vegetable count to 2.</p>
		<p>The menu display shows a pie chart for the nutritional balance of the menu plus a reference view of an ideal meal.</p>
		<h3><a name="tutorialCreate"></a><span class='ui-icon ui-icon-pencil inline'></span>Adding Content</h3>
		<p>To add a new dish or ingredient to your library, click the Dish and Ingredient buttons in the upper left.  A new item will be created and pulled up in edit view in the center of the page.</p>
		<p>As you edit, the item will be saved automatically -- if the save button us greyed and and says "Saved" you know all your content is safely stored on the server.</p>
		<h3><a name="tutorialSug"></a>Suggestions</h3>
		<p>You can make notes about suggestions for each dish; use this if there's a common pairing of things that go well together, or if there's an alternative dish that is a good substitute.</p>
		<p>You can drag a link to a dish onto the center pane to create a suggestion, or you can type in the name of the dish.  You will then be prompted to specify if this is a suggestion for an alternative or a dish that would be recommended to go with the original.</p>
