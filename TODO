- search on keyword
- filter search on rating
- list dishes that go well with a dish (pairing)
- list alternative dishes 
- gather menu/possible menu (flags)
- if editing dish, add new ingredients rather than forcing separate add ingredient
- create library, so we filter on library ancestor NOT user field
- REFACTOR:
  - create library, w/ owner 
  - library is ancestor to each entry
  - tag = new entity type
  - tags are children of dish and ingredient
  - add keywords
    - turn punctuation into spaces
    - split on space
    - add keyword for each piece > 1
